	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Chen-Hua Wang, and you can call me Danny. I was graduated from Tunghai University. My Bachelor’s degree is in Electrical Engineering. My graduation project is the electrical bicycle. Professor Liu and my team wrote a code to control the power supply between the solar system and electrical supply. Furthermore, we built the charging station on campus. After my mandatory military service, I was recruited by Leadermac Machinary Co, Ltd. My position is R&D engineer which is to customize circuit boards and develop a new interface. Our products are all customized, so engineers should redesign the circuit board. Also, my manager and I should create a new interface system to control machines. </p>
  <p>In 2018, I started my master’s degree which is Analytics at Northeastern University. I learned a lot of professional skills and knowledge such as data mining, modeling, R, Python, and so on. I made a lot of projects such as survival prediction, Loan analysis, student engagement…etc. </p>
  <p>For the survival prediction project, I created a linear regression model to find the relationship between survival possibility and factors in R. </p>
  <p>For the loan analysis project, I created a random forest model and regression models to distinguish good or bad loans in R. </p>
  <p>For the student engagement project, I created an interactive dashboard to represent student engagement based on multiple datasets in Python. </p>
  <p>I have been trained as a professional analyst in two years. Furthermore, I improve my English ability when I lived in Boston. I believe that I fit some positions which related with Data Analysis. </p>
